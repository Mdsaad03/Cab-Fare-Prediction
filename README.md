# Cab-Fare-Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict cab fares using regression techniques. The project included data cleaning, feature engineering, and optimizing model performance for accurate predictions.
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict cab fares based on a dataset containing various features such as pickup and drop-off locations, date, time, and distance. The objective was to create an accurate predictive model to estimate cab fares by performing thorough data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and cleaned erroneous data entries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features like distance using the Haversine formula based on coordinates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the data to understand distributions, outliers, and trends.
- **Modeling**: Implemented and trained regression models using Scikit-learn to make predictions.
- **Model Optimization**: Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
- **Output**: Saved the model's predictions to a CSV file using Pandas for further analysis.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

This project provided hands-on experience in data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, and optimization, contributing to enhanced predictive analytics skills.
